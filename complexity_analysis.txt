Convex Hull Algorithm Complexity

Time Complexity:
Let n be the number of input points.
The algorithm takes O(nLogn) time if we use a O(nLogn) sorting algorithm eg quick sort.
The first step (finding the bottom-most point) takes O(n) time.
The second step (sorting points) takes O(nLogn) time.
The third step takes O(n) time.
In the third step, every element is pushed and popped at most one time.
So the sixth step to process points one by one takes O(n) time,
assuming that the stack operations take O(1) time.
Overall complexity is O(n) + O(nLogn) + O(n) + O(n) which is O(nLogn).

Space complexity:
Space complexity is equal to number of points i.e O(n)
